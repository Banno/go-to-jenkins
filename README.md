# Go to Jenkins

This is a Chrome extension that adds a link to a GitHub pull request that navigates to the job in Jenkins.

## Build

1. Update the `version` in `manifest.json`.
2. Run `./bin/build`.
3. Find the archive, e.g. `./output/go-to-jenkins-v1.0.0.zip`, where the version is taken from `manifest.json`.
4. Upload the archived package in the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/).
